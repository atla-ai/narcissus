- [ ] **Add conversation branches** that demonstrate different failure modes and recovery patterns

### Metrics & Instrumentation

- [ ] **Add metrics tracking** with specific labels for demo scenarios
- [ ] **Implement custom metrics** beyond basic traces
- [ ] **Add performance comparisons** demonstrating ATLA's value
- [ ] **Create debugging scenarios** that highlight observability features

## Information Quality & User Experience

### Documentation

- [ ] **Enhance README** with better overview, setup instructions, and value proposition
- [ ] **Add interactive examples** showing ATLA integration benefits
- [ ] **Create deployment documentation** for both components
- [ ] **Add troubleshooting guide** for common setup issues

### User Interface

- [ ] **Improve error handling** with user-friendly messages
- [ ] **Add conversation starters** in the UI to guide users
- [ ] **Implement proper error boundaries** in the UI
- [ ] **Add loading states** and better user feedback

## SDK Integration Showcase

### Examples & Demonstrations

- [ ] **Add instrumentation examples** showing before/after ATLA integration
- [ ] **Create side-by-side comparisons** of instrumented vs non-instrumented agents
- [ ] **Add code snippets** demonstrating key ATLA SDK features
- [ ] **Implement feature-specific demo scenarios**

### Technical Implementation

- [ ] **Add custom trace attributes** for better demo categorization
- [ ] **Implement sampling strategies** for different demo types
- [ ] **Add trace filtering** for specific demo scenarios
- [ ] **Create trace visualization helpers**

## Production Readiness

### Configuration & Deployment

- [ ] **Add rate limiting** and API key management
- [ ] **Create environment-specific configurations**
- [ ] **Implement health checks** for both services
- [ ] **Add Docker configurations** for easy deployment

### Security & Reliability

- [ ] **Add input validation** and sanitization
- [ ] **Implement proper secrets management**
- [ ] **Add monitoring and alerting** setup
- [ ] **Create backup and recovery procedures**

## Content & Personality Enhancements

### Agent Intelligence

- [ ] **Expand system prompt** with more ATLA-specific knowledge
- [ ] **Add conversation memory** for better demo experiences
- [ ] **Implement topic routing** to relevant ATLA features
- [ ] **Add proactive feature suggestions** based on user queries

### Content Management

- [ ] **Create content templates** for different user personas
- [ ] **Add dynamic content updates** from ATLA documentation
- [ ] **Implement conversation analytics** to improve responses
- [ ] **Add A/B testing** for different conversation approaches

## Demo Data Quality

### Scenario Generation

- [ ] **Create realistic customer journey scenarios**
- [ ] **Add edge cases** and error handling demonstrations
- [ ] **Implement multi-session conversations**
- [ ] **Add integration failure scenarios** for debugging demos

### Data Variety

- [ ] **Generate conversations** across different industries
- [ ] **Add various complexity levels** (simple to advanced use cases)
- [ ] **Create seasonal/time-based scenarios**
- [ ] **Implement user persona variations**

## Analytics & Insights

### Demo Effectiveness

- [ ] **Track demo engagement metrics**
- [ ] **Measure conversion from demo to trial**
- [ ] **Analyze most effective conversation patterns**
- [ ] **Create feedback collection mechanisms**

### Platform Insights

- [ ] **Generate reports** on demo data quality
